Communities of close contacts can begin protecting themselves with Contact Tracing immediately; we don't need millions of people to install the app, and we don't have to wait for testing to ramp up. By installing Contact Tracing and reporting symptoms, you and the people you interact with can create your own early warning system to detect and respond to any infectious disease such as COVID-19.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"615\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJd_jHnlf1Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
